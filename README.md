# nudge-d

[nudge](https://github.com/rasmusbarr/nudge) (optimized physics library) bindings for Dlang

based on this [commit](bb00cb2985aa6b50babf4c76adcea5928b90ea91) of nudge, mirrored to `lib/nudge`

## setup

1. build `nudge`: go to `lib/nudge` and run `./build.sh`
2. you can now use the bindings library!
3. optionally, go to `example/` and `dub run` to run the demo.
